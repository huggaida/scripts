## Specials > Bezier CAD

### Boolean
Select exactly two bezier splines to combine their area into a new one by union, intersection or difference.

### Intersection
Select at least two segments to split them at their intersections.

### Merge Ends
Merges two end control points into one while preserving the relative positions of their handles.

### Subdivide
Blender only allows for uniform subdivision.
This operator enables you to select multiple segments and split them at custom parameters simultaneously.

### Circle
Add a bezier circle which completes the selected segment into a full circle.

### Length
Measures the arc length of the selected bezier segments.



## Add > Toolpath

### Offset Curve
Creates a toolpath with a defined offset to the selected splines.

### Rect Macro
Creates a toolpath for a rectangular area.

### Drill Macro
Creates a toolpath for a circular hole.



## File > Export

### SVG (for Laser Cutting)
- Fills and Colors
- Selection Only / All Visible
- Viewport Projection / Local Orthographic Projection
- Absolute / Relative Coords
- SVG Path: Move To, Line To, Curve To, Close
- Units

### G-Code (for CNC Milling)
Exports the active curve.
It must contain exactly one spline / polygon which must be non cyclic.
- Feed Rate: The "softbody goal weight" is used to encode this information per vertex
- Seek: Fast movement
- Line: Slow movement while cutting
- Circle: Reconstructed from bezier curves
